General, Response Headers and Request Headers.

- What is the purpose of status codes?

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
Informational responses (100–199)
Successful responses (200–299)
Redirection messages (300–399)
Client error responses (400–499)
Server error responses (500–599)

- What can an HTTP message contain?

HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.
