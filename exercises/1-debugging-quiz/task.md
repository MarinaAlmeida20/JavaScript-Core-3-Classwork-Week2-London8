# Debugging quiz

Let's see what you remember from last week!

You should answer in a _thread_ on Slack

1. What are the four questions we ask ourselves in the Debugging Framework?
2. What are three of the tools we could use to debug our programs?
3. What is a `syntax` error?

An exception caused by the incorrect use of a pre-defined syntax. Syntax errors are detected while compiling or parsing source code.

For example, if you leave off a closing brace (}) when defining a JavaScript function, you trigger a syntax error.

4. What is a `reference` error?

The ReferenceError object represents an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced.

5. What is a `type` error?

The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type.

A TypeError may be thrown when:

an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function; or
when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed; or
when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.
